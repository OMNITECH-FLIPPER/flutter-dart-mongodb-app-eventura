# Eventura Event Management System - Complete Application

## 🎉 Application Status: 100% COMPLETE & READY TO RUN

The Eventura Event Management System is now fully implemented and ready for deployment on Chrome web platform with full feature integration.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Run the complete application with one command:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File start_full_app.ps1
```

This will:
1. ✅ Start the backend server (Node.js + MongoDB)
2. ✅ Launch the Flutter web application in Chrome
3. ✅ Configure CORS and API endpoints
4. ✅ Open the application automatically in your browser

## 🔧 Manual Start (Alternative)

If you prefer to start components separately:

### Backend Server
```bash
node server.js
```
Server runs on: http://localhost:3000

### Frontend (Flutter Web)
```bash
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 8080
```
App runs on: http://localhost:8080

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Compilation Errors - RESOLVED
- ❌ **Issue**: Missing MongoDB methods (addNotification, getNotifications, markNotificationRead, getAnalyticsData)
- ✅ **Solution**: Updated DatabaseService to use API endpoints instead of direct MongoDB calls
- ❌ **Issue**: Certificate upload parameter mismatch
- ✅ **Solution**: Fixed uploadCertificate method signature in certificate_download_screen.dart

### 2. CORS Configuration - RESOLVED
- ❌ **Issue**: Flutter web couldn't connect to backend API due to CORS restrictions
- ✅ **Solution**: Updated server.js with permissive CORS settings for development
- ✅ **Result**: All HTTP requests from Flutter web to backend now work properly

### 3. Chrome Web Compatibility - RESOLVED
- ❌ **Issue**: App wouldn't run properly on Chrome web platform
